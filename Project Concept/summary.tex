\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

This project is designed and implemented by using the concept of linked data to serve a website for those researchers who try to find other researchers with the same interested so that they can contract and collaboratively work together. Furthermore, the linked data also can be integrated with other websites in such a way, unlike traditional relational databases.
