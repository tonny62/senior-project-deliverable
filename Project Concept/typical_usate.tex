\section{Typical Usage}
\label{sec:usage}
How will the system be used in a typical scenario? What are some of the key features? Example:

The online course evaluation system will be populated with course information by staff, with most of the information being automatically transferred from Registration. Towards the end of a semester, students will have a fixed period to access the system and evaluate each course. Evaluation will involve filling in an online form. When evaluations are complete the system will collect summary information. Administrators will login and view/download reports on lecturers, courses, schools and other groupings. Reports will include useful statistics such as mean, median, quartiles, both for current semester and compared to past semesters. Lecturers will also be able to login and see a summary for their courses.
