\section{Main Challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}
One of the most challenging is how to efficiently implement linked data such data are collected from the news, publications,  project proposal, and researcher databases. Another is that the algorithms that can correctly classify from which sources that the researchers belong to. Last but not least is that how we can develop APIs of our system so that we can contribute our linked data to the community.
