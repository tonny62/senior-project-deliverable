\section{Main Challenges}
\label{sec:challenges}

What is  the hardest and/or most time consuming part of the project? Example:

The main challenge of this project is the user interface. In particular, a user interface that allows students to select answers to different types of questions without requiring much effort (e.g. without the need to read instructions), and a user interface to allow administrators/lecturers to extract useful information from the evaluations (e.g. view summary statistics for all courses). A carefully designed user interface for students is important because any survey should be self-explanatory, fast to complete and ask relevant questions. The user interface for administrators will be difficult because they may desire many different views of the information (e.g. graphical vs numerical; per course, school, lecturer, year; correlations with different metrics).
